This project was created by George Papasotiriou for the ITC-4247-SECURE-SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT course in 2025. Its a local API Application with generic vulnerabilities along with a security testing tool (SecurityTester.java) (Fuzzer) to display those vulnerabilities. It was designed for Intelij IDEA. 
IMPORTANT BEFORE STARTING:
Download the latest releashe or the Final Project V3.rar to use the project in InteliJ IDEA.

OR 

Use Secure API App MyACGLibrary folder directly from github repo:

And run

DataInitializer.java --> Initializes database with sample data on application startup (Delete if you want to use DB to its fullest and not reset it for testing purposes)

Major updates:
Final Project V1 featured a Memory H2 Database 
Final Project V2 featured a local database that worked in InteliJ IDEA, however some errors were observed + it wouldn't load DB without DataInitializer.java (Kept logs = Not Vulnerable to Repudiation attacks)
Final Project V3 features a fully working Database with logging actions (Fixed Repudiation issues in V2, Image: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1208143224137318411/1450415554488963153/image.png?ex=6942743f&is=694122bf&hm=4ac410a4ce8265bed94d57d3c9955083ce402343245382ea078ac9f4dcfe69b8&)

IMPORTANT: THE SECURITY TOOL CAN BE FOUND WITHIN THE INTELIJ IDEA PROJECT UNDER THE NAME SecurityTester.java RUN IT DIRECTLY FROM INTELIJ AFTER RUNNING MyACGLibrary

I would recommend downloading Final Project V3.rar either from releashes or from the repo files for use.
